# Digit-Recognizer

This is Scratch code of Digit Recognizer with numpy and no TF/Keras.

The Digit Recognizer project is a machine learning-based project designed to classify and identify numbers. This project is a trained model to deliver almost accurate predictions.

I got this from a youtuber reference.

For the datasets of Train and Testing data sets, get those from here below link

I made a lot of changes on his code and i got 83.2% accuracy of finding digits.

If you want another references go to kaggle and search this prompt -- "Digit Recognizer".

There you will get a lot of references and even various types of code with differnet types of frameworks and datasets for each code.

If you had a trouble of using or using first time of google colab or don't know how to use these platforms. Try yourself on the Kaggle notebook. It is freindly interface for the beginners.

There is a similar project i was done named Dog Breed Identification which figure outs the dog breeds by giving the output of dog breed images with names.
